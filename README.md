The Whiteboard Application Using OpenCV is a digital platform designed to replicate 
the functionality of traditional physical whiteboards while harnessing the capabilities of 
computer vision technology. This application allows users to draw, write, and collaborate in a 
digital space, enhancing remote communication, creative expression, and interactive learning 
experiences. The application supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to engage 
in synchronous drawing and annotation on a shared canvas. The integration of collaborative 
features promotes remote teamwork, virtual brainstorming, and interactive educational sessions.
